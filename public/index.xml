First, they make some tweaks to the data to account for a few key events. In the days of and soon after a national convention, 538 makes downward adjustments to make up for the likely uptick in support. They made it clear that these recalibrations only occur if there was a substantial change in support, so candidates with little change are not impacted. 538 justifies this because both Trump and Clinton had their highest daily polling averages in the week during and after their respective national conventions.&#xA;Additionally, 538 is not afraid to make calculated assumptions about certain regions of America. Their forecasting model will detect an uptick in support for Biden in Maine, and begin to raise projections for him in Vermont New Hampshire, or other like-minded New England states. 538 has set up a map of 10 regions across the US that represent geographically, economically, and socially similar groups of states. My favorite of those groups is Tex-ish, which includes the great states of Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.&#xA;Next, 538 polls on buckets of factors, like economic indicators including jobs, spending, personal income, and manufacturing. The motivation for these distinctions comes from the issue of only tracking GDP: it is too slow. The model has been trained on historical measures of this data, some of which go back nearly 100 years. Another bucket includes info on political factors, like office incumbency status or party incumbency status. By combining fundamental measures of economic growth and public opinion with this new, advanced forecast model, 538 is able to present an incredibly accurate prediction of the next election!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, nor a secret, that most Americans vote with their pocketbook in mind.&#xA;According to the Pew Research Center in a poll from September 9th of this year, the &lt;em&gt;greatest&lt;/em&gt; concern among both Trump and Harris supporters is the economy. The next greatest issue, health care, is only ranked at highly concerning to 65% of voters, compared to the 81% when asked about the American economy.[1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all! I am so excited to begin on this journey of forecasting the 2024 Presidential Election. Please understand that this will be updated often, and I have no guarantee that this projection will be correct! Thanks for reading - VB&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Past Vote Share - Overall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the more critical aspects of forecasting is understanding the past. Data can be an incredible tool in understanding past elections, will will allow us to predict the next ones. Below, you will see the two party national vote distribution for the past ~70 years, from 1948 to 2020. You should note that elections are closer now than at most times in our recent history. This can make projections more difficult, as votes are less unanimous!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
