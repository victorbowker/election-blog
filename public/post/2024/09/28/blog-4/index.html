<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
<p>Hello and thank you for coming back to another week of election predictions! This week, I am primarily focusing on incumbency, and the impacts it can have on an election. In general ways, incumbents are given <em>a lot</em> of advantages. This can make it very difficult for new, emerging canddiates to get a foothold in the race, lending an explanation to usually over 90% of all Congressional incumbents winning their re-election bids.[1]</p>
<p>First, lets talk about why it is so easy for incumbents to win re-election. Simply put, their status as an incumbent can be incredibly helpful. Constituents are already familiar with the candidate&rsquo;s positions and track record. Additionally, there is a feeling of comfort with familiarity, meaning unless an incumbent committed an atrocity, its likely they will be re-elected [2]</p>
<p>When you consider Political Action Committees, which funnel financial support to candidates, the picture becomes even clearer. There is a cycle of support from a PAC, then a Congressman does them favors (or simply votes as they would, coincidentally aligning with PAC views) by voting on bills, then the PAC gives more money.
