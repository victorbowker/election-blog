# Thanks for coming back

Welcome back! This is week 6, and I approve this message.
(get it?)

This week is all about campaign ads!!! Interestingly, my mention of campaign ads may cause groans from some, but others perhaps a mere nod; do you wonder why? Let me tell you!

Campaigns spend incredible amounts of money (NYT says 500 million will be spent between early September and Election Day) but this money is not allocated evenly across the country.[1] In the following graphs, I will first explain how campaigns allocate ad spending across states. Next, I will show you how the tone of these ads can differ. Then I will wrap up with some of my _favorite_ campaign ads, then finally an update to my presidential projection!

Excited? Great, me too, so lets go!










# Ad Tone

Its safe to say that if you are interested enough in the election to read this blog then you probably have seen a campaign ad or two. In the case you have not, let me show you a somewhat hostile commercial released by the Biden Campaign, a few weeks prior to Biden's stepping down from the race.

Next, take a look at a non-hostile ad, from Senior Senator of New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen.

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

You can see the obvious differences between those two ads, right?
One is simply attacking the other candidate, reminding voters of past hostility and reasons to not vote for Fmr. President Trump. The second, Shaheen's ad, is only touting her accomplishments, leveraging real voters to prove her lasting impact. 

Below, you will see a breakdown of campaign ads in the Presidential race, between 2000 and 2012. The tone of each ad is presented as a percentage of total ads run by each party!

# Do Ads Matter?

Now, after seeing some ads, and seeing how their tones vary, you may be wondering, do ads matter? There are a few historical examples that could shed some light on that question. 

**Bush v. Dukakis**

In 1988, George H. W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis for President. The reasons for this outcome are numerous, but the one I'd like to draw your attention to is Bush's attack ad campaigns. 

Below you will see two ads, both attacking Dukakis on military support and crime, respectively. Dukakis himself reflected after the campaign and attributed his loss in great part to his campaign's restraint with returning hostile ads towards Bush. [2]
