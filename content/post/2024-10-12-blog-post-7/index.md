Week 6


# Thanks for coming back

Welcome back! This is week 6, and I approve this message.
(get it?)

This week is all about campaign ads!!! Interestingly, my mention of campaign ads may cause groans from some, but others perhaps a mere nod; do you wonder why? Let me tell you!

Campaigns spend incredible amounts of money (NYT says 500 million will be spent between early September and Election Day) but this money is not allocated evenly across the country.[1] In the following graphs, I will first explain how campaigns allocate ad spending across states. Next, I will show you how the tone of these ads can differ. Then I will wrap up with some of my _favorite_ campaign ads, then finally an update to my presidential projection!

Excited? Great, me too, so lets go!










# Ad Tone

Its safe to say that if you are interested enough in the election to read this blog then you probably have seen a campaign ad or two.
