**Welcome**


Hello and thank you for coming back to another week of election predictions! This week, I am primarily focusing on incumbency, and the impacts it can have on an election. In general ways, incumbents are given _a lot_ of advantages. This can make it very difficult for new, emerging canddiates to get a foothold in the race, lending an explanation to usually over 90% of all Congressional incumbents winning their re-election bids.[1]

First, lets talk about why it is so easy for incumbents to win re-election. Simply put, their status as an incumbent can be incredibly helpful. Constituents are already familiar with the candidate's positions and track record. Additionally, there is a feeling of comfort with familiarity, meaning unless an incumbent committed an atrocity, its likely they will be re-elected [2]

When you consider Political Action Committees, which funnel financial support to candidates, the picture becomes even clearer. There is a cycle of support from a PAC, then a Congressman does them favors (or simply votes as they would, coincidentally aligning with PAC views) by voting on bills, then the PAC gives more money.

So, you may wonder, could we just make a prediction that nearly all of Congress will win re-election (if they seek it) and there is a pretty good chance that the President will win? NO!

That would simply be too easy--and ignoring too much information. We have seen many times where candidates lost as incumbents, like George H. W. Bush or Donald Trump. Additionally, there are many factors still at play that would be neglected if we simply look at past results.
